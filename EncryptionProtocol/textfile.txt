In this paper, we describe our cryptographic schemes for the problem of searching on encrypted data and provide
proofs of security for the resulting crypto systems. Our techniques have a number of crucial advantages. They are
provably secure: they provide provable secrecy for encryption, in the sense that the untrusted server cannot learn
anything about the plaintext when only given the ciphertext
